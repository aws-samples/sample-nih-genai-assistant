VENTILATION WITH LOWER TIDAL VOLUMES AS COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL TIDAL VOLUMES FOR ACUTE LUNG INJURY AND THE ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

THE ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME NETWORK*

ABSTRACT

Background Traditional approaches to mechanical
ventilation use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilo-
gram of body weight and may cause stretch-induced
lung injury in patients with acute lung injury and the
acute respiratory distress syndrome. We therefore
conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation
with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical
outcomes in these patients.

Methods Patients with acute lung injury and the
acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in
a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared
traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an
initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted
body weight and an airway pressure measured after
a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau
pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation
with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial
tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body
weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or
less. The first primary outcome was death before a
patient was discharged home and was breathing
without assistance. The second primary outcome
was the number of days without ventilator use from
day 1 to day 28.

Results The trial was stopped after the enrollment
of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the
group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the
group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 per-
cent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of
days without ventilator use during the first 28 days
after randomization was greater in this group (mean
[SS], 12 11 vs. 10+11; P=0.007). The mean tidal
volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2+0.8 and 11.8+0.8 ml
per kilogram of predicted body weight (P<0.001), re-
spectively, and the mean plateau pressures were
25 6 and 33+8 cm of water (P<0.001), respectively.
Conclusions In patients with acute lung injury and
the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical
ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is tradition-
ally used results in decreased mortality and increas-
es the number of days without ventilator use. (N Engli

T
HE mortality rate from acute lung injury
and the acute respiratory distress syndrome¹
is approximately 40 to 50 percent. 2-4 Al-
though substantial progress has been made
in elucidating the mechanisms of acute lung injury,5
there has been little progress in developing effective
treatments.

Traditional approaches to mechanical ventilation
use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body
weight. These volumes are larger than those in nor-
mal subjects at rest (range, 7 to 8 ml per kilogram),
but they are frequently necessary to achieve normal
values for the partial pressure of arterial carbon diox-
ide and pH. Since atelectasis and edema reduce aer-
ated lung volumes in patients with acute lung injury
and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, 7,8 inspir-
atory airway pressures are often high, suggesting the
presence of excessive distention, or "stretch," of the
aerated lung. In animals, ventilation with the use of
large tidal volumes caused the disruption of pulmo-
nary epithelium and endothelium, lung inflammation,
atelectasis, hypoxemia, and the release of inflamma-
tory mediators.9-14 The release of inflammatory me-
diators could increase lung inflammation and cause in-
jury to other organs. 10,15 Thus, the traditional approach
to mechanical ventilation may exacerbate or perpet-
uate lung injury in patients with acute lung injury and
the acute respiratory distress syndrome and increase
the risk of nonpulmonary organ or system failure.

The use of lower tidal volumes during ventilation
in patients with acute lung injury and the acute res-
piratory distress syndrome may reduce injurious lung
stretch and the release of inflammatory mediators. 16-18
However, this approach may cause respiratory aci-
dosis16,17 and decrease arterial oxygenation and
may therefore require changes in the priority of some
objectives in the care of these patients. With the tra-
ditional approach, the attainment of normal partial
pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH is given
a higher priority than is protection of the lung from
excessive stretch. With an approach that involves low-
er tidal volumes, the reverse is true. Uncontrolled
studies suggested that the use of a lower tidal volume
would reduce mortality in patients with acute lung
injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,
but the results of four randomized trials of lung-
protecting ventilation strategies have been conflict-
ing.21-24 The present trial was conducted to deter-
mine whether the use of a lower tidal volume with
mechanical ventilation would improve important clin-
ical outcomes in such patients.

METHODS

Patients

Patients were recruited from March 1996 through March 1999
at the 10 university centers of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syn-
drome Network of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
(the centers are listed in the Appendix). The protocol was approved
by the institutional review board at each hospital, and informed
consent was obtained from the patients or surrogates at all but
one hospital, where this requirement was waived. A complete de-
scription of the methods is available on the World Wide Web (at
www.ardsnet.org) or from the National Auxiliary Publications
Service (NAPS).*

Patients who were intubated and receiving mechanical ventila-
tion were eligible for the study if they had an acute decrease in
the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of in-
spired oxygen to 300 or less (indicating the onset of hypoxemia;
values were adjusted for altitude in Denver and Salt Lake City),
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on a chest radiograph consistent with
the presence of edema, and no clinical evidence of left atrial hy-
pertension or (if measured) a pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure
of 18 mm Hg or less.1 Patients were excluded if 36 hours had
elapsed since they met the first three criteria; they were younger
than 18 years of age; they had participated in other trials within
30 days before the first three criteria were met; they were preg-
nant; they had increased intracranial pressure, neuromuscular dis-
ease that could impair spontaneous breathing, sickle cell disease,
or severe chronic respiratory disease; they weighed more than 1 kg
per centimeter of height; they had burns over more than 30
percent of their body-surface area; they had other conditions with
an estimated 6-month mortality rate of more than 50 percent; they
had undergone bone marrow or lung transplantation; they had
chronic liver disease (as defined by Child-Pugh class C)25 or their
attending physician refused or was unwilling to agree to the use
of full life support.

A centralized interactive voice system was used for randomiza-
tion. Patients were randomly assigned to receive mechanical ven-
tilation involving either traditional tidal volumes or lower tidal
volumes.

Ventilator Procedures

The volume-assist-control mode was used for the ventilator un-
til the patient was weaned from the device or for 28 days after
randomization on day 0. Because normal lung volumes are predict-
ed on the basis of sex and height,20 a predicted body weight
was calculated for each patient from these data. The predicted
body weight of male patients was calculated as equal to 50+
(centimeters of --152.4) that of female patients was
calculated as equal to 45.5 + 0.91 (centimeters of height 152.4).
In the group treated with traditional tidal volumes, the initial tid-
al volume was 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. This
was subsequently reduced stepwise by 1 ml per kilogram of pre-
dicted body weight if necessary to maintain the airway pressure
measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau
pressure) at a level of 50 cm of water or less. The minimal tidal vol-
ume was 4 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. If the pla-
teau pressure dropped below 45 cm of water, the tidal volume was
increased in steps of 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight
until the plateau pressure was at least 45 cm of water or the tidal
volume was 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight.

In the group treated with lower tidal volumes, the tidal volume
was reduced to 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight within
four hours after randomization and was subsequently reduced
stepwise by 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight if neces-
sary to maintain plateau pressure at a level of no more than 30 cm
of water. The minimal tidal volume was 4 ml per kilogram of pre-
dicted body weight. If plateau pressure dropped below 25 cm of
water, tidal volume was increased in steps of 1 ml per kilogram of
predicted body weight until the plateau pressure was at least 25 cm
of water or the tidal volume was 6 ml per kilogram of predicted
body weight. For patients with severe dyspnea, the tidal volume
could be increased to 7 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body
weight if the plateau pressure remained 30 cm of water or less.

Plateau pressures were measured with a half-second inspiratory
pause at four-hour intervals and after changes in the tidal volume
or positive end-expiratory pressure. Plateau pressures of more than
50 cm of water in the patients in the group treated with tradi-
tional tidal volumes and of more than 30 cm of water in patients
in the group treated with lower tidal volumes were allowed if the
tidal volume was 4 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight or
if arterial pH was less than 7.15.

All other objectives and ventilation procedures, including wean-
ing, were identical in the two study groups (Table If a patient
became able to breathe without assistance but subsequently re-
quired additional mechanical ventilation within a period of 28 days,
the same tidal-volume protocol was resumed.

Organ or System Failure

Patients were monitored daily for 28 days for signs of the fail-
ure of nonpulmonary organs and systems. 29 Circulatory failure
was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or
the need for treatment with any vasopressor; coagulation failure as
a platelet count of 80,000 per cubic millimeter or less; hepatic fail-
ure as a serum bilirubin concentration of at least 2 mg per deciliter
(34 umol per liter); and renal failure as a serum creatinine concen-
tration of at least 2 mg per deciliter (177 umol per liter). We cal-
culated the number of days without organ or system failure by sub-
tracting the number of days with organ failure from the lesser of 28
days or the number of days to death. Organs and systems were con-
sidered failure-free after patients were discharged from the hospital.

Plasma Interleukin-6 Concentrations

Blood samples were obtained from 204 of the first 234 patients
on day 0 and on day 3 for measurement of plasma interleukin-6
by immunoassay (R & D Systems, Minneapolis). Blood samples
were stored in sterile EDTA-treated glass tubes.

Data Collection

Data on demographic, physiologic, and radiographic character-
istics, coexisting conditions, and medications were recorded with-

*PaO2 denotes partial pressure of arterial oxygen, SpO2 oxyhemoglobin saturation measured by
pulse oximetry, FiO2 fraction of inspired oxygen, and PEEP positive end-expiratory pressure.

Subsequent adjustments in tidal volume were made to maintain a plateau pressure of <50 cm of
water in the group receiving traditional tidal volumes and <30 cm of water in the group receiving
lower tidal volumes.

Further increases in PEEP, to 34 cm of water, were allowed but were not required.

in four hours before the ventilator settings were changed on day 0.
Physiologic and radiographic data, medication use, and use of oth-
er investigational treatments were recorded between 6 and 10 a.m.
on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Data were transmitted weekly
to the network coordinating center. Patients were followed until
day 180 or until they were breathing on their own at home.

Assessment of Compliance

Randomly selected ventilator and blood gas variables were an-
alyzed for compatibility with the protocol. Quarterly reports of
these data from each of the 10 centers were used by investigators
to assess compliance.

Statistical Analysis

The first primary outcome was death before a patient was dis-
charged home and was breathing without assistance. Patients who
were in other types of health care facilities at 180 days were con-
sidered to have been discharged from the hospital and to be breath-
ing without assistance. The second primary outcome was ventila-
tor-free days, defined as the number of days from day 1 to day 28
on which a patient breathed without assistance, if the period of
unassisted breathing lasted at least 48 consecutive hours. A differ-

ence in ventilator-free days could reflect a difference in mortality,
ventilator days among survivors, or both. Other outcomes were
the number of days without organ or system failure and the OC-
currence of barotrauma, defined as any new pneumothorax, pneu-
momediastinum, or subcutaneous emphysema, or a pneumatocele
that was more than 2 cm in diameter. Interim analyses were con-
ducted by an independent data and safety monitoring board after
the enrollment of each successive group of approximately 200 pa-
tients. Stopping boundaries (with a two-sided a level of 0.05) were
designed to allow early termination of the study if the use of lower
tidal volumes was found to be either efficacious³ or ineffective.32

The comparison of traditional with lower tidal volumes was
one of two trials conducted simultaneously in the same patients
in a factorial experimental design. Ketoconazole was compared with
placebo in the first 234 patients, and lisofylline was compared with
placebo in the last 194 patients; no drugs were assessed in the
middle 433 patients.

We used Student's t-test or Fisher's exact test to compare base-
line variables. We used analysis of covariance to compare log-trans-
formed plasma interleukin-6 values. We used Wilcoxon's test to
compare the day 0 and day 3 plasma interleukin-6 concentrations,
ventilator-free days, and organ-failure-free days, which had skewed
distributions. We used the 180-day cumulative incidence of mor-

tality to compare the proportion of patients in each group who
died before being discharged home and breathing without assist-
ance,3 33 after stratification for other experimental interventions:
treatment with ketoconazole, the ketoconazole placebo, lisofylline,
the lisofylline placebo, or no other agent. We used a chi-square
test to determine whether there was an interaction between the
study group and the other experimental interventions with re-
spect to the mean (+SE) mortality rates at 180 days. All P values
are two-sided.

RESULTS

The trial was stopped after the fourth interim analy-
sis because the use of lower tidal volumes was found
to be efficacious (P=0.005 for the difference in mor-
tality between groups; P value for the stopping bound-
ary, 0.023). The base-line characteristics of the 861
patients who were enrolled were similar, except that
minute ventilation was slightly but significantly high-
er (P=0.01) in the group treated with lower tidal
volumes (Table 2).

The tidal volumes and plateau pressures were sig-

*Plus-minus values are means SSD. Because of rounding, not all per-
centages total 100. PaO denotes partial pressure of arterial oxygen, and
FiO2 fraction of inspired oxygen.

APACHE III denotes Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Eval-
uation. Scores can range from 0 to 299, with higher scores indicating more
severe illness.34

Data were missing for one patient.

Data were available for 300 patients in the group treated with lower tid-

nificantly lower on days 1, 3, and 7 in the group
treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group
treated with traditional tidal volumes (Table 3). The
mean (+SD) tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2+
0.8 and 11.8+0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body
weight (P<0.001), respectively, and the mean pla-
teau pressures were 25 +6 and 33+8 cm of water
(P<0.001), respectively. The partial pressure of ar-
terial oxygen was similar in the two groups at all three
times, but the positive end-expiratory pressure and
fraction of inspired oxygen were significantly higher
and the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to
fraction of inspired oxygen was significantly lower in
the group treated with lower tidal volumes on days
1 and 3. On day 7, positive end-expiratory pressure
and the fraction of inspired oxygen were significantly
higher in the group treated with traditional tidal vol-
umes. The respiratory rate was significantly higher in
the group treated with lower tidal volumes on days
1 and 3, but minute ventilation was similar in the two
groups on these days. The partial pressure of arterial
carbon dioxide was significantly higher on days 1, 3,
and 7 and arterial pH was significantly lower on days
1 and 3 in the group treated with lower tidal volumes.

The probability of survival and of being discharged
home and breathing without assistance during the
first 180 days after randomization is shown in Figure
1. The mortality rate was 39.8 percent in the group
treated with traditional tidal volumes and 31.0 per-
cent in the group treated with lower tidal volumes
P=0.007; 95 percent confidence interval for the
difference between groups, 2.4 to 15.3 percent). The
interaction between the study group and stratifica-
tion for other experimental interventions was not sig-
nificant P=0.16).

Data were available to calculate the static compli-
ance of the respiratory system at base line in 517 pa-
tients (Fig. 2). The interaction between the quartile
of static compliance at base line and the study group
with respect to the risk of death was not significant
(P=0.49).

The number of ventilator-free days was significantly
higher in the group treated with lower tidal volumes
than in the group treated with traditional tidal vol-
umes (Table 4). The median duration of ventilation
was 8 days among patients in both groups who were
discharged from the hospital after weaning and 10.5
and 10 days, respectively, among those who died in
the group treated with lower tidal volumes and the
group treated with traditional tidal volumes. The num-
ber of days without nonpulmonary organ or system
failure was significantly higher in the group treated
with lower tidal volumes (P=0.006). This group had
more days without circulatory failure (mean [+SD],
19+10 VS. 17 = 11 days; P=0.004), coagulation fail-
ure (21+10 VS. 19+11 days, P=0.004), and renal
failure (20+11 VS. 18+11 days, P=0.005) than did

incidence of barotrauma after randomization was sim-
ilar in the two groups.

There were no significant differences between
groups in the percentages of days on which neuro-
muscular-blocking drugs were used among patients
who were discharged home and breathing without
assistance (6+14 percent in the group treated with
lower tidal volumes and 6+15 percent in the group
treated with traditional tidal volumes) or among those
who died (20+32 percent and 16+28 percent, respec-
tively), or in the percentages of days on which seda-
tives were used among patients who were discharged
home and breathing without assistance (65+26 per-
cent and percent, respectively) or those who
died (73+24 percent and 71+28 percent, respec-
tively). Investigational treatments for acute lung in-
jury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome that
were not included in the factorial design of the ex-
perimental interventions were given to 15 patients
in the group treated with lower tidal volumes and 12

patients in the group treated with traditional tidal
volumes. These included prone positioning in 14 and
9 patients, respectively.

The mean log-transformed plasma interleukin-6
values decreased from 2.5+0.7 pg per milliliter on
day 0 to 2.3+0.7 pg per milliliter on day 3 in the
group treated with traditional tidal volumes and from
2.5+0.7 pg per milliliter to 2.0+0.5 pg per milliliter
in the group treated with lower tidal volumes. The
decrease was greater in the group treated with lower
tidal volumes (P<0.001), and the day 3 plasma in-
terleukin-6 concentrations were also lower in this
group (P=0.002).

DISCUSSION

In this large study of patients with acute lung in-
jury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mor-
tality was reduced by 22 percent and the number of
ventilator-free days was greater in the group treated
with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated

Figure 1. Probability of Survival and of Being Discharged Home
and Breathing without Assistance during the First 180 Days af-
ter Randomization in Patients with Acute Lung Injury and the
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

The status at 180 days or at the end of the study was known for
all but nine patients. Data on these 9 patients and on 22 addi-
tional patients who were hospitalized at the time of the fourth
interim analysis were censored.

with traditional tidal volumes. These results are con-
sistent with the results of experiments in animals9
and observational studies in humans. 16,17

These benefits occurred despite the higher require-
ments for positive end-expiratory pressure and frac-
tion of inspired oxygen and the lower ratio of partial
pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired ox-
ygen in the group treated with lower tidal volumes

*Plus-minus values are means SSD. The number of ventilator-free days
is the mean number of days from day 1 to day 28 on which the patient had
been breathing without assistance for at least 48 consecutive hours. Baro-
trauma was defined as any new pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or
subcutaneous emphysema, or a pneumatocele that was more than 2 cm in
diameter. Organ and system failures were defined as described in the Meth-
ods section.

on days 1 and 3. These results, coupled with the great-
er reductions in plasma interleukin-6 concentrations,
suggest that the group treated with lower tidal vol-
umes had less lung inflammation. 35 The greater
re-
ductions in plasma interleukin-6 concentrations may
also reflect a reduced systemic inflammatory response
to lung injury, which could contribute to the higher
number of days without organ or system failure and
the lower mortality in the group treated with lower
tidal volumes. 15

Several factors could explain the difference in re-
sults between our trial and other trials of ventilation
using lower tidal volumes in patients with acute lung
injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. 22-24
First, our study had a greater difference in tidal vol-
umes between groups. In one earlier trial, the tradi-
tional tidal volume was equivalent to approximately
12.2 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and
the lower tidal volume was equivalent to approximate-
ly 8.1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. 23
In a second study, the traditional and lower tidal vol-
umes were approximately 10.3 and 7.1 ml per kilo-
gram of dry body weight (calculated as the measured
weight minus the estimated weight gain from fluid
retention), respectively. 22 In the present trial, meas-
ured weight exceeded predicted body weight by ap-
proximately 20 percent. Assuming a similar difference,
and assuming that half the difference was dry weight
in excess of predicted body weight, tidal volumes in
the second trial would have been approximately 11.3
and 7.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight.
Therefore, the traditional tidal volume of 11.8 ml
per kilogram of predicted body weight in our study
was similar to the values in the previous two trials.

VENTILATION WITH LOWER TIDAL VOLUMES IN PATIENTS WITH THE ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

However, the tidal volume of 6.2 ml per kilogram of
predicted body weight in the group receiving lower
tidal volumes was lower than the values in the pre-
vious two trials.

If one assumes that measured weights also exceed-
ed predicted body weights by 20 percent in the ear-
lier trials, the tidal volumes in the traditional groups
were approximately 10.2 and 9.4 ml per kilogram of
measured weight, respectively, as compared with 9.9
ml per kilogram of measured weight in our study.
Therefore, the tidal volumes in the traditional groups
in each of the three trials were consistent with tradi-
tional recommendations.

A second possible explanation for the different re-
sults is that the previous trials were designed to detect
larger differences in mortality between groups.
Hence, they lacked the statistical power to demon-
strate the moderate effects of lower tidal volumes that
we found.

A third difference in the trials was in the treat-
ment of acidosis. Increases in the ventilator rate were
required and bicarbonate infusions were allowed to
correct mild-to-moderate acidosis in our study, which
resulted in smaller differences in the partial pressure
of arterial carbon dioxide and pH between the study
groups than in the previous trials. 22-24 The deleteri-
ous effects of acidosis in the previous studies may
have counteracted a protective effect of the lower
tidal volumes.

In addition to being caused by excessive stretch,
lung injury may also result from repeated opening
and closing of small airways or from excessive stress
at margins between aerated and atelectatic regions of
the lungs. 37 These types of lung injury may be pre-
vented by the use of a higher positive end-expiratory
pressure. 10,13,37,38 A slightly higher positive end-expir-
atory pressure was necessary in the group treated with
lower tidal volumes during the first few days to main-
tain arterial oxygenation at a level similar to that in
the group treated with traditional tidal volumes, but
positive end-expiratory pressure was not increased as
a means of protecting the lungs.

In a recent trial in 53 patients with acute respira-
tory distress syndrome, 28-day mortality was signif-
icantly lower with a ventilation strategy that used
a higher positive end-expiratory pressure combined
with limited peak inspiratory pressure than with a
strategy of traditional ventilation. 21 These results sug-
gest that both increased positive end-expiratory pres-
sure and reduced inspiratory stretch could have ben-
eficial effects.

Stretch-induced lung injury may not occur if lung
compliance is not greatly reduced. However, the ben-
efit of ventilation with a lower tidal volume was in-
dependent of the static compliance of the respiratory
system at base line, suggesting that the lower tidal vol-
ume was advantageous regardless of lung compliance.
Variations in chest-wall compliance, which contrib-

utes to compliance of the respiratory system and is
reduced in many patients with acute lung injury and
the acute respiratory distress syndrome,39 may have
obscured a true interaction between tidal volume and
base-line lung compliance.

Barotrauma occurred with similar frequency in
the two study groups, a finding consistent with the
results of other studies in which the incidence of baro-
trauma was independent of airway pressures. 22-24,40,41
The most common manifestation of barotrauma was
pneumothorax, which could have been the result of
invasive procedures. Pneumothorax is not a sensitive
or specific marker of stretch-induced injury with the
tidal volumes used in this study.

The similarity in the number of days of ventilator
use among the survivors in both groups suggests that
the higher number of ventilator-free days in the group
treated with lower tidal volumes resulted from re-
duced mortality rather than from a reduced number
of days of ventilation among the survivors. However,
the comparison of the number of days of ventilator
use among the survivors could be misleading. 42 Some
patients who would have survived in the group treat-
ed with traditional tidal volumes might have needed
the ventilator on fewer days had they been in the
group treated with lower tidal volumes. This bene-
ficial effect would have been obscured if prolonged
ventilation was required before recovery among pa-
tients who otherwise would have died in the group
treated with traditional tidal volumes. For similar
reasons, it is also difficult to compare the number of
days with organ or system failure among the survi-
vors in the two study groups.

We found that treatment with a ventilation ap-
proach designed to protect the lungs from excessive
stretch resulted in improvements in several impor-
tant clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung in-
jury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. On
the basis of these results, high priority should be
given to preventing excessive lung stretch during ad-
justments to mechanical ventilation, and this lower-
tidal-volume protocol should be used in patients with
acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress
syndrome.
