Project Narrative

The proposed research is relevant to public health because discovery of successful collision prevention
techniques will lead to fewer young women who sustain collision-based musculoskeletal injuries, which
account for over 50% of all on field injuries in contact sport. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because
the knowledge gained will be used to optimize prevention strategies that will enhance health and reduce the
burdens of such musculoskeletal injuries that afflict women at twice the rate compared to males.
